``Add`` and ``change`` views for writers have four fieldsets.

``Last name`` and ``first name`` fields in the first, quite self-explanatory.
Only last name is required. For bands, band name goes into ``last name`` field.

``ISNI`` is a unique and unambiguous identifier for performing artists.

    This section is only visible if file uploads are configured.

This section has two fields:

* ``Description`` - for public description

like.

   List view

There are no filters, only a search field. In the table, beside the three fields, 
there are two counters with links, to the :doc:`list of recordings <manual_recording>` 
by this artist the :doc:`list of works <manual_work>` performed by this artist LIVE.
It is also used if the recording data is not available.
