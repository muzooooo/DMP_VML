Support
=================================

No individual support is available for DMP, 
which is usual for open-source projects. Because most music professionals 
are unfamiliar with this concept, an explanation is due here.

Creator of this software is not the vendor for your instance of DMP. You are.

If you run into an issue with any third party, most notably a CMO or 
their administrative agency, and they tell you to ask your software 
vendor for support, that would be you. 

If you forget your password and have to reset it, there is no one who 
can do it but you.

If you have any issues whatsoever, solving them is solely your 
responsibility.

Having said that, here is what you can try.

Documentation
---------------------------------

The first step in resolving any issues is reading the relevant 
parts of this documentation, most notably the
:doc:`manual`. If you are not sure what is relevant, 
use search. If it does not help, read everything.

Videos
-------------------------------

Go to :doc:`Videos <videos>` and watch the videos. If you are not
familiar with **all** terms from Music Metadata Basics series,
watch the relevant videos. Then watch the whole DMP series.

Questions and Discussions
---------------------------------

If you still don't know how to resolve the issue, you should try 
asking in the Facebook Group `Music Publisher Support 
<https://www.facebook.com/groups/musicpublishersupport>`_. 
Before you do, search the group for similar questions. 

Alternatively, you can do it in `Discussions 
<https://github.com/matijakolaric-com/django-music-publisher/discussions>`_ 
within the code repository.

Bug and Feature Requests
----------------------------------

If you believe you have encountered a bug in DMP, you can search
through `issues 
<https://github.com/matijakolaric-com/django-music-publisher/issues>`_, 
or raise a new one.

How can you be sure if it is a bug? Here are some rules.

Bug
+++

If you repeatedly encounter *500 Server Error*, it is a bug. 
Please report it. All such bugs are usually fixed within a week. 
Make sure you are following the thread, so you know when the bug
is fixed. You still need to update your DMP instance yourself.

Not a bug
+++++++++

If you see errors, that are incomprehensible to you, during data
imports or acknowledgement imports, this is not a bug. You can 
still report it as issue, but that will not help you in short 
term. Creator of DMP might make the error more comprehensible 
in one of the next versions, but don't count on it.

Unlikely a bug
++++++++++++++

If things work, but not the way you would like, that is probably 
not a bug. You can still raise an issue, and it will be 
investigated. However, if it is not a bug, it might be rejected 
without an explanation.

Upgrade to Commercial
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. container:: tgt

    `That Green Thing <https://matijakolaric.com/thatgreenthing>`_ *is 
    the commercial upgrade to DMP. It has many more features and comes 
    with professional support. Migration from an unmodified DMP 
    instance is included in the price.*
